The [Moodle Tracker](http://tracker.moodle.org/) is our database for recording and managing all Moodle development issues - bugs, improvements and feature requests.

:::tip

For an intro guide to the tracker, see [Tracker introduction](./).

To do anything more than browsing and searching in the tracker, you'll need to [create an account](http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/Signup%21default.jspa) and then login.

## Tracker groups and permissions

There are a number of groups used to define the potential of users in Tracker. Here are some important ones.

| Name  | Jira group  | Potential   | How to become one   |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Users**  | jira-users  | Users can create new issues, comment on issues, vote for issues, link issues, attach files, create sub-tasks and watch issues.  | Anyone who creates a tracker account becomes a member of the Users group.   |
| **Moodle Security**  | moodle-security  | Trusted developers and administrators who need to work on security issues that are hidden from normal users. See [Moodle security procedures](../process/security/index.md).  | This is generally limited to developers at Moodle HQ and Partner organisations. People wishing join the Moodle Security group should email [security@moodle.org](mailto:security@moodle.org) with the reasons for your request.  |
| **Developers**  | jira-developers   | Developers can edit issues and assign issues to themselves. They are also able to request peer reviews. They cannot submit code directly for integration review, but an HQ staff member or component lead can do this after a satisfactory peer review. See [Process](../process). | People wishing to join the Developers group should be able to demonstrate a history of contributing patches to issues.<br/><br/>When a developer's first patch is integrated, tested and the issue is closed, they are added to the group and set as issue assignee.<br/><br/>If that doesn't happen automatically, please send an email to [integration@moodle.com](mailto:integration@moodle.com) with your tracker username and links to issues where you have contributed patches.  |
| **Integration requesters**  | pull-requesters  | Developers can send issues for integration review. See [Process](../process).  | This role is reserved for Moodle HQ developers and component leads.  |
| **Integration testers**  | pull-testers  | Users that can tests issues under integration and pass/fail them. See [Process](../process).  | Usually reserved for HQ developers and external testers.  |

:::note

You can browse a project without being logged in to Tracker, however you will be to unable edit or comment on bugs.

| **Summary** | A brief, concise description of the problem. | When the issue is about applying an existing solution to another, usually older, branch (namely "[backport](../policies/backporting.md)"), please use the summary of the existing solution plus its issue number (i.e. "Fix forum alignment (backport of [MDL-99999](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-99999))"). |
| **Description**  | A full and complete description of the issue including:<br/><ul><li>replication steps,</li><li>the expected result,</li><li>the actual result,</li><li>any error messages shown with [debugging](https://docs.moodle.org//en/Debugging) turned on, and</li><li>any other relevant information.</li></ul> |  |
| **Affects Version/s** | <ul><li>For bugs: the latest released version in which the bug is found</li><li>For improvements: the latest released version</li><li>For new features: Use 'Future dev'</li></ul> |  |

A decision should be made as soon as possible to set another level.</li></ul> |

### When editing an issue

Once an issue has been created, the following additional fields are able to be changed/set by editing the issue. Not all users can edit all fields.

| Field  | Values  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|
| **Fixed Version/s**  | <ul><li>Prior to integration, this will be blank or set to a backlog (a queue of development work), for example `Must fix for X`.</li><li>After integration, this will be set to the Moodle version(s) the issue was fixed in, for example `4.0.1`.</li><li>For more detailed information, look to the **Resolution** field below.</li></ul>  | <ul><li>This is usually set by an integrator.</li><li>Not to be confused with `Affected version`, which is used to define the Moodle version where the issue can be reproduced.</li><li>If you resolve the bug as anything but `Fixed` and, sometimes, `Done` (like `Cannot Reproduce`, `Won't Fix`, etc.) leave **Fix Version/s** blank.</li><li>**Fix version/s** are used to automatically build release notes (see the tabs on <http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL>)</li></ul>  |
| **Priority**  | <ul><li>**Blocker**<br/>Blocks development or testing, prevents Moodle from running. Applicable to bugs only.</li><li>**Critical**<br/>Crashes server, loss of data, severe memory leak</li><li>**Major**<br/>Major loss of function, incorrect output</li><li>**Minor**<br/>Minor loss of function where workaround is possible</li><li>**Trivial**<br/>Cosmetic problem like misspelt words or misaligned text</li></ul>  | <ul><li>When it is reported, the priority level represents the severity of a bug.</li><li>After being reported, the priority may be promoted by HQ developers and component leads as an issue escalates.</li><li>Other users wishing to influence the priority of issues should do so by voting for the issue.</li><li>The priority of new features and improvements should generally remain at the default (Minor) level.</li></ul>  |
| **Reporter**  | The person who logs the bug.<br/>This field is automatically filled by Tracker.  |   |
| **Assignee**  | The person who will fix the issue. The assignee should be set when there is a definite intention to complete the issue.  | <ul><li>Developers or QA Testers can reassign issues.</li><li>Please note that even though a person may be assigned to an issue, this does not mean they are currently working on the issue, although they are likely to in future.</li></ul>  |
| **Peer reviewer**  | The person who will check the fix at the code level. See [Peer-review](../process/peer-review.md). |   |
| **Integrator**  | The person who will integrate the code into the Moodle codebase. See [Integration-review](../process/integration/index.md). |   |
