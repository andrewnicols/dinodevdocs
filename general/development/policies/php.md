import { Since } from '@site/src/components';

New PHP versions are [released every year](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) and come with important improvements and changes compared with previous versions. Moodle tries to support them as soon as possible, always matching them with our own [scheduled release plans](../../releases.md).

## Policy statement

<Since versions={["3.5"]} issueNumber="MDL-59159" />

We always follow this agreed policy regarding PHP and Moodle supported versions:

1. A LTS will always **require the previous LTS** (or later) for upgrading.
2. The **maximum PHP version** supported for a branch will be the max one achieved along the life of the branch. Usually with .0 releases but may happen later (we added support for php80 with 3.11.8, or support for php81 with 4.1.2, for example).
3. The **minimum PHP** version supported for a branch will be **the lower of**:
    - The [minimum version supported in any way by php](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) the day of the Moodle release (so we provide slow, progressive increments).
    - The maximum PHP version supported by the previous LTS branch (so we guarantee jumping between LTS is possible without upgrading PHP at the same time).
