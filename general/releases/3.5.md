Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 3.5](https://tracker.moodle.org/secure/IssueNavigator!executeAdvanced.jspa?jqlQuery=project+%3D+mdl+AND+resolution+%3D+fixed+AND+fixVersion+in+%28%223.5%22%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC&runQuery=true&clear=true).

See our [New Features page](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/New_features) for a more user-friendly introduction to Moodle 3.5 with screenshots.

If you are upgrading from previous version, make sure you read the [Upgrading](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Upgrading) documentation.

## Server requirements

These are just the minimum supported versions. We recommend keeping all of your software and operating systems up-to-date.

- Moodle upgrade:  Moodle 3.1 or later
- PHP version: minimum PHP 7.0.0 *Note: minimum PHP version has increased since Moodle 3.3*. PHP 7.1.x and 7.2.x are supported too. See [Moodle and PHP](../development/policies/php.md) for details.
- PHP extension **intl** is required since Moodle 3.4 (it was recommended in 2.0 onwards)
- (Recommendation only) If you use MySQL or MariaDB, make sure your database supports full UTF-8 (utf8mb4) if you install a new instance of Moodle. CLI script may be used to convert to utf8mb4 if you're upgrading. You may choose to keep using 'utf8_*', but then a warning will show that the database isn't using full UTF-8 support and suggest moving to 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'. See [MySQL full unicode support](https://docs.moodle.org/en/MySQL_full_unicode_support) for details. If you do enable utf8mb4 you *must* use the Barracuda file format.

### Database requirements

Moodle supports the following database servers. Again, version numbers are just the minimum supported version. We recommend running the latest stable version of any software.

| Database | Minimum version | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) | 9.3 | 11.x - note that 12.x is not yet supported ([MDL-67414](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-67414)) |
| [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) | 5.5.31 | Latest |
| [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) | 5.5.31 | Latest |
| [Microsoft SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) | 2008 | Latest |
| [Oracle Database](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html) | 10.2 | Latest |

#### Upgrading plugins

**1. Check for changes in core APIs**

Read lib/upgrade.txt to check for the deprecations and core API changes, make sure you applied them to your plugin. Note that entries there are not sorted by priority but rather by integration time. Below is the list of upgrade.txt files that contain information about upgrading from Moodle 3.4 to Moodle 3.5 (note that if you upgrade from earlier versions there may be more files):

- [lib/upgrade.txt](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/v3.5.0/lib/upgrade.txt) changes to various core APIs, deprecations, functions removal

**3. Check for changes in the depended plugins**

If your plugin depends on another plugin or calls methods from another plugin, read upgrade.txt in this plugin directory (if it exists). Below is the list of standard plugins that had changes between Moodle 3.4 and 3.5:

[tool_mobile](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/v3.5.0/admin/tool/mobile/upgrade.txt),
