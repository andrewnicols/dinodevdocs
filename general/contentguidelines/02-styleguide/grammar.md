## Capitalisation

- Capitalise proper nouns: names of people, places, and organisations. Capitalise also geographic terms such as countries and cities, and historic episodes and events.
- Use sentence case for all headlines and headings.
- Don't use ALLCAPS unless you're writing an acronym.
- For email addresses and website URLs, use all lowercase.

## Punctuation

### Apostrophes

- To make a possessive from a noun that ends in -s, use only an apostrophe (no s).

> Example: Matias' Moodle site runs on 4.3.

- Pluralise acronyms by adding -s.

> Example: These URLs are secure.

### Ampersands

- Don't use an ampersand (&) or a plus sign (+) to mean 'and', unless it's used in a brand name.

### Contractions

- Use contractions for common phrases, such as 'don't' or 'can't'.

> Example: These passwords don't match.
> Example: Students can't see who marked their work.

### Commas

- When writing lists, always use the Oxford comma.

> Example: This includes user ID, role, and course ID.

### Dashes and hyphens

- Use an em dash (—) with spaces before and after to offset an aside, and use an en dash (–) to connect a range of numbers or dates.

> Example: The newest version of Moodle LMS —released last month— has had 200,000 downloads.
> There will be 200-250 attendees.

### Exclamation marks

- Save exclamation marks for key moments in the user journey.
- Don't use more than one exclamation mark.

### Percentages

- With numbers, use '%' instead of the word 'percent'.

> Example: You've completed 89% of the course.

### Periods

- Don't user periods in country acronyms.

> Example: Their headquarters are located in New York, USA.

## Dates, numbers and currencies

### Dates, months, and years

- For short dates, use DD/MM/YYYY without any leading zeros.

> Example: 21/12/1975 or 21/3/2020

- For long dates, use DD Month YYYY without any leading zeros.

> Example: 21 December 1975

- If you include the day of the week in a date, add a comma after the day.

> Example: Friday, December 21

- For days of the week, use the following abbreviations: Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun.

### Time and time zones

- Write 'am' and 'pm' always in lowercase, with no space before them and with no periods between the letters.

> Example: 2:00pm, not 2:00 pm

- For times on the hour, include minutes.

> Example: 6:00pm, not 6pm

### Numbers, fractions, and units

- Spell out numbers if they're the first word in a sentence.

> Example: Three days left to get early bird tickets.

- To separate thousands and millions, use commas.
- To indicate decimal points, use periods.

> Example: 1,000 (one thousand); 3.14 (three point one four)

- Always use a country code with phone numbers.

- For units of measure, use lowercase letters and don't leave a space before the unit

> Example: 121km, not 121 km.

- When you write a decimal, include a leading zero before the decimal point.

> Example: 0.75, not .75.

### Currencies and money

- For currencies, put the symbol before the amount, with no space in between.

> Example: €300, not 300€

- Don't use periods in currency abbreviations.

> Example: AUD, not A.U.D

- Spell out thousand, million, billion, and trillion in full.

> Example: 3 million users, not 3M users.
> Example 10 thousand resources, not 10K resources.

## Emojis

- Emojis can make your writing more fun, but don't go overboard with them :wink:.
- Don't use negative emojis, such as 😡 😒 🤢 👹 ☠️
