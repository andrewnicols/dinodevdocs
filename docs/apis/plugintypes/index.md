Moodle is a powerful, and very extensible, Learning Management System. One of its core tenets is its extensibility, and this is primarily achieved through the development of plugins.

A wider range of plugin types are available and these should be selected depending on your needs.

## Things you can find in all plugins

Although there are many different types of plugin, there are some things that work the same way in all plugin types. Please see the [Plugin files](./commonfiles) documentation that describes common files which are found in many plugin types.

## Naming conventions

Plugins typically have at least two names:

- The friendly name, shown to users, and
- A machine name used internally.

The machine name must meet the following rules:

- It must start with a lowercase latin letter
- It may contain only lowercase latin letters, numbers, and underscores
- It must end with a lowercase latin letter, or a number
- The hyphen, and minus character `-` are not allowed

If a plugin does not meet these requirements then it will be silently ignored.

:::tip

Plugin name validation takes place in `core_component::is_valid_plugin_name()` and the following regular expression is used:

```
/^[a-z](?:[a-z0-9_](?!__))*[](a-z0-9)+$/
```

:::

:::danger Activity module exception

The underscore character is not supported in activity modules for legacy reasons.

<summary> Obtaining the list of plugin types known to your Moodle </summary>

You can get an exact list of valid plugin types for your Moodle version using the following example:

```php title="/plugintypes.php"
<?php
define('CLI_SCRIPT', true);
require('config.php');

$pluginman = core_plugin_manager::instance();

foreach ($pluginman->get_plugin_types() as $type => $dir) {
    $dir = substr($dir, strlen($CFG->dirroot));
    printf(
        "%-20s %-50s %s" . PHP_EOL,
        $type,
        $pluginman->plugintype_name_plural($type),
        $dir)
    ;
}
```
