Welcome to the new Moodle Developer documentation, your main resource in Moodle development.

## Contributing

Moodle is made by people like you, and so is its documentation. Moodlers are members of a big, worldwide, community of developers, designers, testers,
teachers, translators, administrators, and many more. We work in universities, schools, companies, NGOs, charities, and all sorts of other places.

You are welcome to join us and to contribute to both the Moodle project, and our Developer Documentation.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies, who want to
learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. If you are new to open source contributions then the following guides may be especially
useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)
- [The Legal Side of Open Source](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
