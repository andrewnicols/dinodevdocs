Moodle has a number of core APIs that provide tools for Moodle scripts.

They are essential when writing [[Plugins|Moodle plugins]].

## Most-used General API

These APIs are critical and will be used by nearly every Moodle plugin.

### Access API (access)

The [Access API](./apis/access) gives you functions so you can determine what the current user is allowed to do, and it allows modules to extend Moodle with new capabilities.

### Data manipulation API (dml)

The [[Data manipulation API]] allows you to read/write to databases in a consistent and safe way.

### File API (files)

The [[File API]] controls the storage of files in connection to various plugins.

### Form API (form)

The [[Form API]] defines and handles user data via web forms.

### Logging API (log)

The [[Events API]] allows you to log events in Moodle, while [[Logging 2]] describes how logs are stored and retrieved.

### Navigation API (navigation)

The [[Navigation API]] allows you to manipulate the navigation tree to add and remove items as you wish.

### Page API (page)

The [[Page API]] is used to set up the current page, add JavaScript, and configure how things will be displayed to the user.

### Output API (output)

The [[Output API]] is used to render the HTML for all parts of the page.

### String API (string)

The [[String API]] is how you get language text strings to use in the user interface. It handles any language translations that might be available.

### Upgrade API (upgrade)

The [[Upgrade API]] is how your module installs and upgrades itself, by keeping track of its own version.

### Moodlelib API (core)

The [[Moodlelib API]] is the central library file of miscellaneous general-purpose Moodle functions. Functions can over the handling of request parameters, configs, user preferences, time, login, mnet, plugins, strings and others. There are plenty of defined constants too.

## Other General API

### Admin settings API (admin)

The [[Admin settings]] API deals with providing configuration options for each plugin and Moodle core.

The [[Availability API]] controls access to activities and sections.

### Backup API (backup)

The [[Backup API]] defines exactly how to convert course data into XML for backup purposes, and the [[Restore API]] describes how to convert it back the other way.

### Check API (check)

### Events API (event)

The [[Events API]] allows to define "events" with payload data to be fired whenever you like, and it also allows you to define handlers to react to these events when they happen. This is the recommended form of inter-plugin communication. This also forms the basis for logging in Moodle.

### Experience API (xAPI)

The Experience API (xAPI) is an e-learning standard that allows learning content and learning systems to speak to each other. The [[Experience API (xAPI)]]
allows any plugin to generate and handle xAPI standard statements.

### External functions API (external)

The [[External functions API]] allows you to create fully parametrised methods that can be accessed by external programs (such as [[Web services]]).

### Favourites API

The [[Favourites API]] allows you to mark items as favourites for a user and manage these favourites. This is often referred to as 'Starred'.

### H5P API (h5p)

The [[Privacy API]] allows you to describe the personal data that you store, and provides the means for that data to be discovered, exported, and deleted on a per-user basis.
This allows compliance with regulation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.

### Rating API (rating)

The [[Rating API]] lets you create AJAX rating interfaces so that users can rate items in your plugin. In an activity module, you may choose to aggregate ratings to form grades.
